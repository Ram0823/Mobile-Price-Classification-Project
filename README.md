# Mobile-Price-Classification-Project

This a Classification Supervised Machine Learning Problem where we have to predict the price range of the smartphones based on the different features. I have taken the dataset from Kaggle and the train.csv file is also uploaded in the respective repository. I have mentioned the Life Cycle that is involved in each Data Science Project and accordingly I have perfomed the steps. I have loaded the dataset, performed Feature Engineering , Feature Scaling, Feature Selection Techniques , Built different Classification models and compared their accuracies and at the last I have performed Hyperparametric Tuning and selected the best model that gave the highest accuracy. I will be uploading this project into 2-3 separate files and then I will upload the complete project in one file.
