# Mobile-Price-Classification-Project

This a Classification Supervised Machine Learning Problem where we have to predict the price range of the smartphones based on the different features. I have taken the dataset from Kaggle and the train.csv file is also uploaded in the respective repository. I have mentioned the Life Cycle that is involved in each Data Science Project and accordingly I have perfomed the steps.
After loading the dataset, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis ,Feature Engineering , Feature Scaling, Feature Selection Techniques , Built different Classification models and compared their accuracies and at the last I have performed Hyperparametric Tuning and selected the best model that gave the highest accuracy.
I have used the plotly.express library for Data Visualisation and the plots plotted by this library are not visible on the Github so please use nbviewer                         to see all those plots just by selecting my file (The link of the nbviewer is provided in the About section).
This project will be uploaded in 2-3 separate files and then I will upload the complete project in one file.
